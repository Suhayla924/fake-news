  <h3>What is Fake News?</h3>
  <hr></hr>
  <ul>
    <li>Fake: <div class="black">a thing that is not genuine; a forgery or sham.</li>
    <li>Hoax: <div class="black">is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It is distinguishable from errors in observation or judgment, rumors, urban legends, pseudosciences. </li>
    <li>Fraud: <div class="black">In law, fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud can violate civil law, a criminal law, or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, for example by obtaining a passport, travel document, or driver's license, or mortgage fraud, where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements.</div></li>
    <li>Sham; <div class="black">a thing that is not what it is purported to be.</div></li>
    <li>Forgery: <div class="black">is a white-collar crime that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a legal instrument with the specific intent to defraud anyone. Tampering with a certain legal instrument may be forbidden by law in some jurisdictions but such an offense is not related to forgery unless the tampered legal instrument was actually used in the course of the crime to defraud another person or entity.</div> </li>
    <li>Imitation: <div class="black">a thing intended to simulate or copy something else.</div></li>
    <li>Counterfeit: <div class="black">To counterfeit means to imitate something authentic, with the intent to steal, destroy, or replace the original, for use in illegal transactions, or otherwise to deceive individuals into believing that the fake is of equal or greater value than the real thing. Counterfeit products are fakes or unauthorized replicas of the real product. Counterfeit products are often produced with the intent to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated product. The word counterfeit frequently describes both the forgeries of currency and documents, as well as the imitations of items such as clothing, handbags, shoes, pharmaceuticals, aviation and automobile parts, watches, electronics, software, works of art, toys, and movies.</div></li>
    <li>Phony: <div class="black">a fraudulent person or thing.</div> </li>
    <li>Bogus: <div class="black">not genuine or true; fake.</div></li>
    <li>Redacted: censor or obscure (part of a text) for legal or security purposes.</li>
